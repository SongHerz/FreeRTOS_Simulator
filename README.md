# FreeRTOS_Simulator

The simulator was originally uploaded to:
http://interactive.freertos.org/entries/420647-Another-Linux-Posix-simulator-using-GCC

at 2011

This was managed by SVN, but I cannot find the SVN repository, and I have not maintained it for years, just move it here for easy management.
